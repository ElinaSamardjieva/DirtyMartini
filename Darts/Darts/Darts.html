                <strong>Welcome to the Dirty Martiny Darts Game!</strong>
                <br />
                <p>The game is played by two players. The object of the game is one of the players to be the first to reach zero from starting
                    total of 301. Each round every player has 3 darts to throw at the board and the score he hits is substracted of his current
                    score. Example: If player one has 30 points left he must hit exactly 30 to win (25 and 5, three times 10 etc.). If he hits
                    more than 30 points with his three darts, his score remains to be 30 and gives the turn to the second player. In simple terms,
                    after three darts are thrown, the throwing player subtracts the total score from his current total until he reaches zero.</p>
